Golang Code to Work With the ABF (ArcBest Freight) API

This is used for scheduling pickups (pickup request) using the ABF API.  ABF is also known as "ArcBest Holdings" or "ArcBest Freight".  This is useful since you can schedule pickups programatically and not call ABF.

Note that some functionality is missing.  I have only added the functionality I use or may use.  See https://arcb.com/tools/api/pickup-request for adding more functionality.

Other instructions are in the code.
